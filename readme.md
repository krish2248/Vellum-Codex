**Vellum Codex** is a beautifully crafted digital library that showcases my personal book collection. Inspired by the elegance of old paper, vintage textures, and the timeless joy of reading, this project is a tribute to the tactile charm of real booksâ€”carefully archived in a minimalist, web-friendly interface.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **LocalStorage** for read/unread state
- **Vanilla JS** for filtering, searching, and UI logic
- **PWA features** (coming soon)

"A room without books is like a body without a soul." â€“ Cicero
Vellum Codex is more than a digital shelfâ€”it's a space to honor the stories, textures, and emotions bound within every cover.
